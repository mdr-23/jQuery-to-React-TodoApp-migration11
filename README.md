# Todo App - jQuery to React Migration

This is a migration of the Todo App from jQuery to React. The original implementation used jQuery for managing the todo list functionality, and now it has been migrated to React, utilizing React's state and components.

## Technologies Used

- React
- JavaScript
- CSS

## Migration Process

The migration involved the following steps:

1. Set up a new React project using `create-react-app`.
2. Created a new `App` component as the entry point of the application.
3. Refactored the HTML structure of the todo list using React components and JSX syntax.
4. Replaced the jQuery code with React state and event handlers.
5. Created a new `useState` hook to manage the input value and the list of tasks.
6. Implemented the functionality to add a new task when the "Enter" key is pressed.
7. Added the ability to delete tasks by filtering the task list based on the task ID.
8. Styled the application using CSS to achieve the desired appearance.

## Usage

To use the Todo App, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install the dependencies using `npm install`.
3. Run the application using `npm start`.
4. Open the application in your browser at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Acknowledgements

This migration was done as a learning exercise to understand the process of migrating from jQuery to React. The original Todo App was created using jQuery and served as a basis for the migration process.

## Conclusion

The migration from jQuery to React has allowed us to take advantage of the benefits of a modern JavaScript framework, such as improved performance, better organization of code, and easier maintenance. React's component-based architecture and state management provide a more structured and scalable approach to building interactive UIs.

By completing this migration, we have successfully transformed the original jQuery-based Todo App into a more robust, maintainable, and efficient React application.
